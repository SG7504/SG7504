About Me

I’m a backend-focused engineer who enjoys building systems that run reliably in production. My interests lie in API design, cloud deployment, and automation, with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals.

I’ve worked on deploying ML-backed services on AWS, debugging production issues using logs and metrics, and improving system reliability through data-driven improvements. I value clean code, clear documentation, and continuous learning.

Experience
AI Data & Quality Assurance Engineer (Freelance)

Soul AI (Deccan AI) · Nov 2025 – Present

Selected for Project Bluebird to perform high-accuracy model evaluation and alignment (RLHF-style workflows).

Evaluated production LLM outputs to identify logical inconsistencies, hallucinations, and safety risks.

Applied structured evaluation rubrics and documented recurring error patterns to support internal model improvement cycles.
